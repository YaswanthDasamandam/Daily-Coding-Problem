#### Problem 1

Given a list of numbers, return whether any two sums to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

#### Problem 2

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

#### Problem 4

Given an array of integers and a positive integer , determine the number of  pairs where  and  +  is divisible by .

Example:
ar = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
k =5


Three pairs meet the criteria:[1,4],[2,3] and[4,6] .

#### Function Description

Complete the divisibleSumPairs function in the editor below.

divisibleSumPairs has the following parameter(s):

*int n: the length of array 
*int ar[n]: an array of integers
*int k: the integer divisor
#### Returns
- int: the number of pairs

#### Input Format

The first line contains  space-separated integers, n and k.
The second line contains  space-separated integers, each a value of arr[i]

#### Problem 8

Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.

For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the node with value 8.

In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.

Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space

#### Problem 9

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given an array of numbers and a number k, determine if there are three entries in the array which add up to the specified number k. For example, given [20, 303, 3, 4, 25] and k = 49, return true as 20 + 4 + 25 = 49.

#### Problem 10

This problem was asked by Microsoft.
Given three 32-bit integers x, y, and b, return x if b is 1 and y if b is 0, using only mathematical or bit operations. You can assume b can only be 1 or 0.

#### Problem 11

Let's define a "sevenish" number to be one which is either a power of 7, or the sum of unique powers of 7. The first few sevenish numbers are 1, 7, 8, 49, and so on. Create an algorithm to find the nth sevenish number.

#### Problem 13

Given an undirected graph G, check whether it is bipartite. Recall that a graph is bipartite if its vertices can be divided into two independent sets, U and V, such that no edge connects vertices of the same set.
